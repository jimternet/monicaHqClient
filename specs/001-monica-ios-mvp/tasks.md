# Tasks: Monica iOS Client MVP

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-monica-ios-mvp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **iOS Project**: `MonicaClient/MonicaClient/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `MonicaClient/MonicaClientTests/`
- Paths shown below assume iOS project structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Authentication (US1) must complete before any other user stories
  - Browse Contacts (US2) and Error Handling (US9) should complete before other features
  - Remaining user stories can proceed in priority order or in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Authentication**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Browse Contacts**: Can start after Authentication - Independent of other features
- **User Story 9 (P1) - Error Handling**: Can start after Authentication - Enhances all other features
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Search**: Can start after Browse Contacts - Independent addition to contact list
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Contact Details**: Can start after Browse Contacts - Independent detail view
- **User Story 10 (P2) - Settings**: Can start after Authentication - Independent settings management
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Activities**: Can start after Contact Details - Enhances detail view
- **User Story 6 (P3) - Relationships**: Can start after Contact Details - Enhances detail view
- **User Story 7 (P3) - Notes & Tasks**: Can start after Contact Details - Enhances detail view
- **User Story 8 (P4) - Tags**: Can start after Contact Details - Enhances detail view

### Within Each User Story

- Models before ViewModels
- Views before ViewModels (for UI-dependent logic)
- API client methods before ViewModels that use them
- Core functionality before integrations and enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Authentication (US1) completes, US2 and US9 can start in parallel
- Once Browse Contacts (US2) completes, all detail-view stories (US4-US8) can start in parallel
- Models within different stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Authentication)

```bash
# Launch foundational models together:
Task: "Create AuthCredentials model in MonicaClient/Features/Authentication/Models/AuthCredentials.swift"
Task: "Create OnboardingView in MonicaClient/Features/Authentication/Views/OnboardingView.swift with cloud/self-hosted selection"
Task: "Create LoginView in MonicaClient/Features/Authentication/Views/LoginView.swift with endpoint and token inputs"

# Then implement ViewModel that depends on them:
Task: "Create AuthenticationViewModel in MonicaClient/Features/Authentication/ViewModels/AuthenticationViewModel.swift"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 9 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Browse Contacts)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 9 (Error Handling)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test these three stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - this provides core value

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add Authentication ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Login MVP!)
3. Add Browse Contacts + Error Handling ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core MVP!)
4. Add Search ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add Contact Details ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add Settings ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Authentication is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Browse Contacts)
   - Developer B: User Story 9 (Error Handling)
3. Once core stories complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Search) + User Story 4 (Contact Details)
   - Developer B: User Story 10 (Settings) + User Story 5 (Activities)
   - Developer C: User Stories 6, 7, 8 (Detail enhancements)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All file paths are absolute and match the project structure from plan.md
- Testing is optional per constitutional requirements - focus on manual testing and user validation
